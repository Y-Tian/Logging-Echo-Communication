Logging:

Practicing logging functions for easier debugging and maintenance on larger software projects.

Echo:

For communication between PC and Arduino, we can use the system library to echo data between the two.

Any sort of data that the PC would like to send to the Arduino, we can send that to the Arduino listener.

Data such as specific rows and columns can be sent to the Arduino, for the Arduino program to recognize that specific row and column.
